# C++ CMake Template Kit
C++ (C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, C++23) and CMake Project Git Architecture

The following project Git repository provides production-grade CMake and modern C++ (C++11+) runner applications
that revolve around C++ smart pointers, C++ atomic smart pointers, C++ concepts (contrained policy templates), C++ ranges
and async with C++ coroutines. Each `Template Kit ToC entry will provide apps that include the preceding C++ constructs.
